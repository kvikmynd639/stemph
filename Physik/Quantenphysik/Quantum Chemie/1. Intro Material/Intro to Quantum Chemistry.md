- Molecular orbitals (analogy to Bohr's model, molecules also have electrons w energy levels that orbit around the nucleus)
- It is the energy of these molecules that determines the bonding of two molecules for instance
- In order to study quantum chemistry by using quantum computers, we have to know a strategy for representing the electronic states using qubits => [[Jordan-Wigner-Representation]]
- In order to predict the properties of the molecules, we need to know energy levels by electrons (for that we require a Hamiltonian)
- Molecule being a very complex thing per se makes it very complicated for Hamiltonian to be accurately computed therefore we use approximation: [[Hartree-Fock-Approximation]]
