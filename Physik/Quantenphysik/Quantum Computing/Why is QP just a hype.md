In this video, a girl who quit quantum computing phD explains why it is just a hype while interconnecting fields like quantum chemistry, quantum simulations, quantum ML, etc.

She explains that the only useful thing for QP now are quantum simulations. They are much better at simulating quantum things than anything else. It is very difficult to create simulations before productions and there they excel. (she gave example of solar cells. It would be good if we could use more than 20-25% potential they offer)

She explained that there are very little algorithms known today that can work with Quantum Comps and nobody is searching for them as they are extremely difficult (which explains the thing). But she bolds on that that one should approach quantum algorithms more rigorously to find a purposeful meaning of quantum computers.

She also added that she was disappointed by quantum chemistry thing
